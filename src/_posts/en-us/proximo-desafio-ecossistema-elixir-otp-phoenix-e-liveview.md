title: "Next challenge: Elixir, OTP, Phoenix and Liveview ecosystem"
excerpt: "My next challenge as a developer is to get into the world of functional programming, for real. I've chosen the Elixir lang as it's a language created by a Brazilian developer and because I've already learn a little bit about it"

These last few weeks, I've been asking myself what's the next thing that will quench my programmer thirst. Beyond simply trying [to finish my solo projects](https://www.erickpatrick.net/en-us/projetos) – they help a lot my "enterpreneur" side – the programmer side wants me to learn something new.

I've been reading a lot on Software Architecture and will continue to do so because it helps with another of my itches: engineering and architecture. This time I've also decided to learn, deeply, another programming language, its ecosystem, and tools.

As the title tells, my next challenge is to deepen my knowledge on the Elixir lang, its ecosystem (OTP & Erland as well), using Phoenix and LiveView para Web.

I believe I already know the basics of the language, I've worked through a few _code katas_, and created some CLI scripts. With this knowledge I think it's already enough to go the next step and start building a web apllication and deploy it o production.

After seeing some many of the capabilities of the Elix lang with just a small amount of resources compared to other langs, it really got me hooked up.

Some examples of the capabilities:

- [How Discord scaled Elixit to 5.000.000 concurrent](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-scaled-elixir-to-5-000-000-concurrent-users)
- [Real time communication at scale with Elixit at Discord](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/)
- [From serverless to Elixir](https://medium.com/coryodaniel/from-erverless-to-elixir-48752db4d7bc)
- [Elixir Saves Pinterest $2 Million a Year In Server Costs](https://paraxial.io/blog/elixir-savings)

Being a programming language created by a Brazilian, José Valim, it's yet another distinguishing feature for me to go headfirst into this journey. I even have some ideas to build and put my knowledge into practice and learn even more.

However, my first idea is to create an alternate version of the admin panel of this website, as it's a simple project but more complex than others I did in Elixir, and with a proper, delimited scope.

With a proper, delimited scope, which I know pretty well for working for years on it will give me a better perspective on Elixit and its tools.

Wish me luck in this new challenge. Those who wish to follow my evolution, just follow me on [~~Twitter~~ X](https://twitter.com/erickpatrick) and on GitHub [GitHub](https://github.com/erickpatrick).

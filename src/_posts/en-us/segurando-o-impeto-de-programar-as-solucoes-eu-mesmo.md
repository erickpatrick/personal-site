I'm currently a eCommerce Engineer Manager. Before that, I was:

- Architect of online systems & eCommerce;
- Team lead eCommerce Development;

Both positions, despite being a leadership position of sorts in the team, I still used to mostly focus on solving things myself. Evaluting problems, MVP creation, ideas and concept evaluation, testing and code review.

About 70% of my time was like that. The remaining 30% took me to various meetings, writing decisions and requeriments, organizing the team's needs.

Today, my work is way different from that. Going up the ladder in the company, bringing me to the engineering manager position, I had to learn to stop instead of going hands-on on all the problems myself.

What was previously 70-30% for development-management, today the numbers are reverted and the gap grew. I believe it's around 90-10 for management-development. Development, specially programming, is mostly in emergencies as I'm the first point of contact.

Due to that, it's quite hard to hold myself while I see my colleagues taking ages to bring solutions or even "alternatives" to what we're facing.

At the same time, I need to guide them to the proper solution, in the correct timeline, without forcing them to come up with the solution I had in mind. In the end, I gave the "thumbs-up" to hire them, right?

I need to show that I trust their decisions and that, much like myself, they're working for th ebest of the team, even when I think we could bring a better solution.

They're capable and are also the ones responsible to maintain the code and solutions. Disregard their choices without a proper reason would sound like I don't trust they're actually capable.

I should only guide them to finish their tasks on time, ensuring their solutions follow the C-Level vision and strategy, based on the OKRs we set together, doing the best they can.

Don't see this post as me complaining about my job, but a realization from someone who was always a hands-on person, grew this way, and now needs to control his crazy desire to solve things himself.

In the last few weeks, I've been working a lot to bring some of my [projects](/projetos) online. It's a challenging work, takes a toll, both physicaly and mentally, and it demands a lot of [_crunch time_](https://www.consumidormoderno.com.br/2023/05/19/crunch-time-o-que-e-e-como-as-empresas-podem-evitar/) almost every day.

I'm fully conscious that _crunch time_ comes from my own targets, goals, and self-push into these projects, and that I could solve this by adjusting them. However, knowing myself, if I don't push myself too much, I end up proscratinating.

So you understand better, many days, I end up going to bed at around 1h30AM and I have to wake up at 6h30AM to take my daughter to school and my white-collar work starts at 7AM.

With this in mind, I get myself thinking if this _crunch time_, this extra stress time will really bring any compensation whatsoever... If I'm the kind of people who work as an enterpreneur or being my own boss...

### The fantasy of being an enterpreneur.

There's a high chance a friend or a relative once said that they wanted to open their own business and become their own bosses. They're fed up of working for others, being quite stressed, and earning so low.

I was that person once. From time to time, I AM that person (just like now, with this extra _crunch time_). And I completely understand this thinking. The daily stress, lack of future, the abuse... Lots of factors sum up leading to us thinking that way.

Some times, it's not really the a question of where you work or the company environment. Many times it's only our desire to create something and call it ours. It's our deep desire, hard to put it away, pushing us to work more to fulfil it.

But at what cost?

### The enterpreneur reality.

[Acording to Sebrae](https://sebrae.com.br/sites/PortalSebrae/artigos/a-taxa-de-sobrevivencia-das-empresas-no-brasil,d5147a3a415f5810VgnVCM1000001b00320aRCRD) (a Brazilian agency to help enterpreneurs), around 30% of freelancers and consultans, and 21% das SMB (small-to-medium businesses) close before 5 years of full activity.

Still, many people want to _"build a company"_. Be it because they will be different and won't make those mistakes, they will create a sustenable business, without stress, making revenue, and end up rich. Unfortunately, most of them will be far away from that target.

And this brings the question: Should we make our lives worse, get more stressed, rest even less, stop enjoying our family and friends? And still risk not getting it right? Is it healthy to invest so much time and money in a path so full of uncertanties?

### The challenge to get your place amongst gods

There's no reason to get it into your head that you have to be an entrepreneur or a boss. This idea is generally associated with the perception that entrepreneurs or bosses are rich people.

While there's some truth to the fact that wealthy people are often entrepreneurs or bosses, not all bosses and entrepreneurs are rich. Many people spend all their money trying to leverage a business and end up failing.

Just remember the Sebrae report. Most are not mentally prepared, don't have a business plan or have a deficient plan, and also don't know how to manage efficiently. Many think it's easy and doesn't require study or effort.

If you really want to follow this path, put in all your effort, study, improve yourself. It won't be easier just because you're in charge now. Understand that you'll have much more work ahead of you.

While before it was just working from 8 am to 6 pm, with 1-2 hours for lunch, now, especially in the beginning, everything is very different. From the moment you wake up until bedtime (or even during your dreams), you only think about the company:

- everyone who depends on your company
- the company's bills
- the services you have to deliver
- the "few hours" to solve all the problems
- the little time with your family
- the activities you missed with your children
- the money you're spending
- the return that's taking too long to arrive
- the necessary bureaucracy and paperwork

This constant stress and pressure isn't for everyone. And that's completely normal. Just as it's not for everyone to practice a sport at a high level, teach other people effectively, be a master in entertainment, and so on.

### It's normal to work for others.

Remember: it's normal not to be an entrepreneur or boss. Otherwise, we all would already be.

We have to change this idea that it's the end of the world to retire having worked only for others. There's nothing wrong with that, and the chances of it happening to any of us are greater than becoming millionaires. It's normal.

Certainly, the vast majority of workers receive a salary far from what would be considered ideal. This doesn't only happen in Brazil, but almost all over the world. And, unfortunately, that's the reality.

However, this doesn't prevent us from seeking better jobs that pay well and give us a certain quality of life. Nothing that will make us filthy rich, but enough so we don't have to worry at the end of the month.

We shouldn't think that we owe our jobs to the company we work for. Of course, we should respect it, giving our best. However, if a better opportunity arises, we don't have to feel guilty about choosing it.

### There are pots of gold at the end of the tunnel too.

We also have to change this idea that it's impossible to live well working for others. It is possible to earn a lot of money working for others, anywhere in the world.

What we need to understand is that, just like when we want to be our own bosses and entrepreneurs, making a lot of money working for others requires a great deal of effort, study, and time invested. Often at the expense of our health and time with our families.

Sometimes, we even need to use tricks, nothing that harms others, but certain flattery, unplanned overtime, turning a blind eye to others' mistakes, all in pursuit of a raise or promotion.

But, once we achieve what we so desire, we can return to our 9-to-5 workdays, enjoy our families, our free time to rest, and still have a good amount of money in the bank.

Depending on your field, it's possible to live very well. Bank employees, with the chance of annual internal training courses; workers in financial institutions; marketing creatives working on campaigns for multinational companies; IT workers, especially those in development...

### The Power of Development

Those of us in development have the advantage of being able to work remotely, receiving payment in a more valuable foreign currency. This possibility of receiving in dollars, euros, pounds, Swiss francs allows companies to hire for a lower rate, while we take advantage of the exchange rate and earn "more".

Even when the jobs aren't remote, sometimes it's possible to live better with little money in another country than living in Brazil with little money. We don't need to be rich to have a good life change.

Simply moving to a place where you can use your cell phone without worrying about theft is already a great improvement. There are also places where both schools and universities are free and of excellent quality, requiring at most investment in personal materials and transportation. The latter can even be covered by the government in many cases.

When moving to one of these places, the initial salary, which initially seemed average, can significantly improve your overall well-being even if it's low, it becomes somewhat attractive. And remember that we don't owe our jobs to any company and we can work and seek better opportunities.

Sometimes, a little is enough for a decent life. And even if it isn't, you will have learned something about your abilities, about what it's like to work outside the home, and what you need to do to find something that is sufficient.

### Life is yours and yours alone

In the end, you are the one who knows what you need for your life. Do you want to start your own business or create your own company? Go and make it happen. Do you want to continue working for others, since there is a "simpler" structure to follow? Continue.

Don't let others decide for you what to do with your life.

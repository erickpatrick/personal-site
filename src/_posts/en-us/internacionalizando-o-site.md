Though I don't update the site as much as I wanted, I'm really happy to know that many people around the world visit and read my content.

Some of those reached out to me and said that they normally use the browser's translation tool (like the Google translate from Chrome) to translate my content into their language. They also said that, though they can understand what I wrote, it would be better to have a proper human translation and thus asked if I could translate the site and the blog posts.

As I publish just a handful per year, I accepted their humble request. It's something that will take just a little bit more of my time but will lead to much more visitors.

I haven't translated all blog posts yet. I've started with this and the previous one ([Tailwind CSS Playgrounds, part 1](/en-us/artigos/tailwind-css-playgrounds-1)). Little-by-little, I'll translate the rest. Before that, I'll write 1 or 2 other new articles, both in Portuguese and in English, of course.

So, keep watching, subscribe to the RSS (in [Portuguese](/pt-br/rss.xml) or in [English](/en-us/rss.xml)) to learn when they're published, and please share the news on your social media.

Thank you and see you all.
